<blockquote>"<I>Some half dozen persons have written technically on combinatory
logic, and most of these, including ourselves, have published
something erroneous.  Since some of our fellow sinners are among the
most careful and competent logicians on the contemporary scene, we
regard this as evidence that the subject is refractory.  Thus fullness
of exposition is necessary for accuracy; and excessive condensation
would be false economy here, even more than it is ordinarily.</I>"

In September of 1987 a meeting was held at the conference on
Functional Programming
Languages and Computer Architecture (FPCA '87) in
Portland, Oregon, to discuss an unfortunate situation
in the functional programming community: there had come into being
more than a dozen non-strict, purely functional programming languages,
all similar in expressive power and semantic underpinnings.  There
was a strong consensus at this meeting that more widespread use of
this class of functional languages was
being hampered by the lack of a common language.  It was decided
that a committee should be formed to design such a language, providing
faster communication of new ideas, a stable foundation for real
applications development, and a vehicle through which others
would be encouraged to use functional languages.  This
document describes the result of that committee's efforts: a purely
functional programming language called Haskell ,

named after the logician Haskell B. Curry
whose work provides the logical basis for much of ours.<p>
<a name="sect1"></a>
<h3>1<tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;</tt>Goals</h3><p>
The committee's primary goal was to design a language that
satisfied these constraints:
<OL><LI>It should be suitable for teaching, research, and applications,
      including building large systems.
<LI>It should be completely described via the publication of a formal
      syntax and semantics.
<LI>It should be freely available.  Anyone should be permitted to
      implement the language and distribute it to whomever they please.
<LI>It should be based on ideas that enjoy a wide consensus.  
<LI>It should reduce unnecessary diversity in functional 
      programming languages.
</OL>
The committee hopes that Haskell  can serve as a
basis for future research in language design.
We hope that extensions or
variants of the language may appear, incorporating experimental
features.<p>
<a name="sect1.1"></a>
<h3>1.1<tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;</tt>Haskell 98</h3><p>
Haskell has evolved continuously since its orignal publication.
By the middle of 1997, there had been four versions of the language
(the latest at that point being Haskell 1.4).  At the 1997 Haskell Workshop 
in Amsterdam, it was decided that a stable variant of Haskell was needed;
this stable language is the subject of this Report, and is called "Haskell 98".<p>
Haskell 98 was conceived as a relatively minor tidy-up of Haskell 1.4, making
some simplifications, and removing some pitfalls for the unwary. It is intended to
be a "stable" language in sense the <I>implementors are committed to supporting
Haskell 98 exactly as specified, for the foreseeable future</I>.<p>
As a separate exercise, Haskell will continue to evolve.  At the time of
writing there are Haskell implementations that support existential types,
local universal polymorphism, rank-2 types, multi-parameter type classes,
pattern guards, exceptions, concurrency, and more besides.  Haskell 98
does not impede these developments.  Instead, it provides a stable point
of reference, so that those who wish to write text books, or use Haskell
for teaching, can do so in the knowledge that Haskell 98 will continue
to exist.  On the few occasions when we refer to the evolving, future version
of Haskell, we call it "Haskell 2".<p>
<a name="sect1.2"></a>
<h3>1.2<tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;</tt>This Report</h3><p>
This report is the official specification of Haskell  98
and should be suitable for writing programs and building
implementations.  It is <I>not</I> a tutorial on programming in
Haskell  such as the `Gentle Introduction' [<a href="haskell.html#$tutorial">5</a>], so some
familiarity with functional languages is assumed. <p>
Haskell 98 is described in two separate
documents: the Haskell Language Report (this document) and the Haskell
Library Report [<a href="haskell.html#$libraries">8</a>].<p>
<a name="sect1.3"></a>
<h3>1.3<tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;</tt>Evolutionary Highlights</h3><p>
For the benefit of those who have some knowledge of earlier
version of Haskell, we briefly summarise the differences between
Haskell 98 and its predecessors.<p>
<a name="sect1.3.1"></a>
<h4>1.3.1<tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;</tt>Highlights of Haskell 98</h4><p>
A complete list of the differences between Haskell 1.4 and Haskell 98
can be found at <tt>http://haskell.org</tt>.
A summary of the main features is as follows:
<UL><LI>List comprehensions have reverted to being list comprehensions,
not monad comprehensions.
<LI>There are several useful generalisations of the module system:
name clashes are reported lazily, and distinct modules can share a local
alias.
<LI>Fixity declarations can appear anywhere a type signature can,
and, like type signatures, bind to an entity rather than to its name.
<LI>"Punning" for records has been removed.
<LI>The class <tt>Eval</tt> has been removed; <tt>seq</tt> is now polymorphic.
<LI>The type <tt>Void</tt> has been removed.
</UL><p>
<a name="sect1.3.2"></a>
<h4>1.3.2<tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;</tt>Highlights of Haskell 1.4</h4><p>
Version 1.4 of the report made the following relatively minor changes to the
language:
<UL><LI>The character set has been changed to Unicode.
<LI>List comprehensions have been generalized to arbitrary
monads.
<LI>Import and export of class methods and constructors is no longer
restricted to `all or nothing' as previously.  Any subset of class
methods or data constructors may be selected for import or export.
Also, constructors and class methods can now be named directly on
import and export lists instead of as components of a type or class.
<LI>Qualified names may now be used as field names in patterns and
updates. 
<LI><tt>Ord</tt> is no longer a superclass of <tt>Enum</tt>.  Some of the default
methods for <tt>Enum</tt> have changed.
<LI>Context restrictions on <tt>newtype</tt> declarations have been relaxed.

<LI>The Prelude is now more explicit about some instances for <tt>Read
</tt>and <tt>Show</tt>.
<LI>The fixity of <tt>&gt;&gt;=</tt> has changed.
</UL><p>
<a name="sect1.3.3"></a>
<h4>1.3.3<tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;</tt>Highlights of Haskell 1.3</h4><p>
Version 1.3 of the report made the following substantial 
changes to the language:<p>
<UL><LI>Prelude and Library entities were distinguished, 
and the Library became a separate Report.
<LI>Monadic I/O was introduced.
<LI>Monadic programming was made more readable through the
introduction of a special <tt>do</tt> syntax.
<LI>Constructor classes were introduced as a 
natural generalization of the original Haskell 
type system, supporting polymorphism over type constructors.
<LI>A number of enhancements were made to Haskell  type
declarations, including: strictness annotations, labelled fields, and
<tt>newtype</tt> declarations.
<LI>A number of changes to the module system were made.
Instead of renaming, qualified names are used to resolve
name conflicts.  All names are now redefinable; there is no
longer a <tt>PreludeCore</tt> module containing names that cannot be
reused.  Interface files are no longer specified by this report; all
issues of separate compilation are now left up to the implementation.
</UL><p>
<a name="sect1.4"></a>
<h3>1.4<tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;</tt>The <I>n+k</I> Pattern Controversy</h3>

For technical reasons, many people feel that <I>n</I><tt>+</tt><I>k</I> patterns are
an incongruous language design feature that should be eliminated
from Haskell .  On the other hand, they serve as a
vehicle for teaching introductory programming, in particular
recursion over natural numbers.  Alternatives to <I>n</I><tt>+</tt><I>k
</I>patterns have been explored, but are too premature to include in
Haskell  98.  Thus we decided to retain this feature
at present but to discourage the use of <I>n</I><tt>+</tt><I>k</I> patterns by Haskell 
users.  This feature may be altered or removed in Haskell 2, 
and should be avoided.
Implementors are encouraged to provide a mechanism for users to
selectively enable or disable <I>n</I><tt>+</tt><I>k</I> patterns.<p>

<h3>1.5<tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;</tt>Haskell  Resources</h3><p>
The Haskell web site
<tt><br>

<br>
	http://haskell.org<br>

<br>

</tt>gives access to many useful resources, including:
<UL><LI>Online versions of the language and library definitions, including
a complete list of all the differences between Haskell 98 and
Haskell 1.4.
<LI>Tutorial material on Haskell.
<LI>Details of the Haskell mailing list.
<LI>Implementations of Haskell.
<LI>Contributed Haskell tools and libraries.
<LI>Applications of Haskell.
</UL>
We welcome your comments, suggestions, and criticisms on the language
or its presentation in the report, via the Haskell mailing list.<p>

We are especially grateful to past members of the Haskell  committee --- Arvind,
Jon Fairbairn, Andy Gordon, Maria M. Guzman, 
Dick Kieburtz, Rishiyur Nikhil,
Mike Reeve, David Wise, and
Jonathan Young --- for the major contributions they have made to
previous versions of this report.
We also thank those who have participated in the lively discussions
about Haskell  on the FP and Haskell  mailing lists.<p>
Finally, aside from the important foundational work laid by Church,
Rosser, Curry, and others on the lambda calculus, we wish to
acknowledge the influence of many noteworthy programming languages
developed over the years.  Although it is difficult to pinpoint the
origin of many ideas, we particularly wish to acknowledge the
influence of Lisp (and its modern-day incarnations Common Lisp and
Scheme); Landin's ISWIM; APL; Backus's FP
[<a href="haskell.html#$back78">1</a>]; ML and Standard ML; Hope and Hope<sup>+</sup>; Clean; Id; Gofer;
Sisal; and Turner's series of languages culminating in 
Miranda. (Miranda is a trademark of Research
Software Ltd.) Without these forerunners Haskell  would not have
been possible.
