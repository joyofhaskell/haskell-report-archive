This document defines the standard libraries for Haskell  98.<p>
The libraries presented here represent a selection of basic
functionality that is expected to be useful to many Haskell 
programmers.  Most implementations provide further libraries
which are not a recognized part of the Haskell  standard.<p>
The latest version of this report, as well many other available libraries,
can be found on the web at <tt>http://haskell.org</tt>.<p>

<h2>1<tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;</tt>Introduction</h2>
<p>
This document defines the standard libraries for Haskell  98.  Like the <tt>Prelude</tt>,
these libraries are a required part of a Haskell 
implementation.  Unlike the Prelude, however, these modules must
be <I>explicitly</I> imported into scope.<p>
When possible, library functions are described solely by executable
Haskell  code.  Functions which require implementation-dependent
primitives are
represented by type signatures without definitions.
Some data types are implementation-dependent: these are indicated
by comments in the source.<p>
The code found here is a <I>specification</I>, rather than an
<I>implementation</I>.  Implementations may choose more efficient versions of
these functions.  However, all
properties of these specifications must be preserved, including
strictness properties. <p>
Classes defined in libraries may be derivable.  This report includes
the derivation of such classes when appropriate.  
When <tt>Prelude</tt> types
are instances of derivable library classes a commented empty instance
declaration is used.  The comment, "as derived", indicates that the
instance is the same as would have been generated by a <tt>deriving</tt> in
the Prelude type declaration. <p>
The following table summarises the fixities of all the operators 
introduced by the standard libraries:
