<CENTER><H1>Changes from Haskell 1.3 to Haskell 1.4</H1></CENTER>

<ul>
    <li>List comprehensions have been generalized to arbitrary
        monads. (See <a
        href="../haskell-report-1.4-html/exps.html#list-comprehensions">Section
        3.11</a>). </li>
    <li>Import and export of class methods and constructors is no
        longer restricted to `all or nothing' as previously. Any
        subset of class methods or data constructors may be
        selected for import or export. Methods and constructors
        are now entities in their own right. (See <a
        href="../haskell-report-1.4-html/modules.html#export">Section
        5.1.1</a>). </li>
    <li>The defaulting rule now applies to type variables
        affected by the monomorphism restriction. (All
        implementations already do this - this officially
        sanctions the existing practice). (See Section <a
        href="../haskell-report-1.4-html/decls.html#default-decls">4.3.4</a>).
    </li>
    <li>Qualified names may now be used as field names in
        patterns and updates. </li>
    <li><tt>Ord</tt> is no longer a superclass of <tt>Enum</tt>.
        Some of the default methods for <tt>Enum</tt> have
        changed. </li>
    <li>Context restrictions on <tt>newtype</tt> declarations
        have been relaxed. (See section <a
        href="../haskell-report-1.4-html/decls.html#datatype-renaming">4.2.3</a>).
    </li>
    <li>The Prelude is now more explicit about some instances for
        <tt>Read </tt>and <tt>Show</tt>. </li>
    <li>The fixity of <tt>&gt;&gt;=</tt> has changed. </li>
    <li>The report is more explicit about context reduction
        problems. (See <a
        href="../haskell-report-1.4-html/decls.html#context-reduction">Section
        4.5.3</a>). </li>
    <li>Ratio and Rational have been added to the export list of
        the prelude. </li>
    <li>We're now using Unicode. See <a
        href="../haskell-report-1.4-html/lexemes.html">Lexical
        Structure</a>. </li>
    <li>There's an extra warning about character IO (see <a
        href="../haskell-report-1.4-html/io-13.html">Input/Output</a>)
    </li>
</ul>

<p>Haskell 1.4 is generally compatible with 1.3 - most of these
changes are upward compatible. You may have problems with type
signatures containing Enum if Ord instances are also used - you
must add an explicit Ord context now that Enum does not imply
Ord. The change in the fixity of <font face="Times New Roman"><kbd>&gt;&gt;=</kbd></font>
may also lead to incompatiblity. Instances which rely on the
defaults in the class Enum may break.</p>
