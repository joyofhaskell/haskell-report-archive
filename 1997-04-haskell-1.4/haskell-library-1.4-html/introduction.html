<h2>1<tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;</tt>Introduction</h2>
<p>
This document defines the standard Haskell  libraries.  Like the Prelude,
these libraries are a required part of a Haskell 
implementation.  Unlike the Prelude, however, these modules must
be <I>explicitly</I> imported into scope.<p>
When possible, library functions are described solely by executable
Haskell  code.  Functions which require implementation-dependent
primitives are
represented by type signatures without definitions.
Some data types are implementation-dependent: these are indicated
by comments in the source.<p>
The code found here is a specification, rather than an
implementation.  Implementations may choose more efficient versions of
these functions.  However, all
properties of these specifications must be preserved, including
strictness properties. <p>
Classes defined in libraries may be derivable.  This report includes
the derivation of such classes when appropriate.  
When Prelude types
are instances of derivable library classes a commented empty instance
declaration is used.  The comment, "as derived", indicates that the
instance is the same as would have been generated by a <tt>deriving</tt> in
the Prelude type declaration. <p>
The libraries presented here represent a selection of basic
functionality that are expected to be useful to many Haskell 
programmers.  Most implementations provide further libraries
which are not a recognized part of the Haskell  standard.<p>
Many other libraries are being actively considered.  The latest
version of this report as well as proposed additions to the library
can be found on the web at <tt>haskell.org</tt>.<p>
We would like to express our thanks to those who have contributed
directly or indirectly to this report without being named as authors.
A proper acknowledgement list will appear in the final (non-draft)
version of the report.  We would, however, especially like to thank
Andy Gill, who made significant contributions to the I/O library;
Sandra Loosemore,
who made many important comments on the I/O library; and Tony Davie
who has carefully examined much of the library code.<p>
