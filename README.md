This is a collection of old versions of the Haskell Report.

Each directory in this repository corresponds to a publication of the Report
and contains, at minimum, the Report in PDF format. Where available, they may
also contain:

* The Report in PostScript, DVI, or HTML format
* The Report's LaTeX and Haskell source code
* A document describing changes from the previous version of the Report
* A separate document describing the standard library

Most of this content was obtained from [haskell.org][1].
We also recovered some dead links from [Internet Archive][2].
The content is mostly preserved as it was found, with some minor adjustments:

* To ensure that there are no broken hyperlinks in HTML documents, most links
  have been changed to relative URLs, a few have been removed, and a few
  erroneous links have been corrected.
* Where a document was available only in PostScript or DVI format, we have
  also included as copy of it converted to PDF format.

See the `README.md` in each directory for further details.
