<blockquote>"<I>Some half dozen persons have written technically on combinatory
logic, and most of these, including ourselves, have published
something erroneous.  Since some of our fellow sinners are among the
most careful and competent logicians on the contemporary scene, we
regard this as evidence that the subject is refractory.  Thus fullness
of exposition is necessary for accuracy; and excessive condensation
would be false economy here, even more than it is ordinarily.</I>"

In September of 1987 a meeting was held at the conference on
Functional Programming
Languages and Computer Architecture (FPCA '87) in
Portland, Oregon, to discuss an unfortunate situation
in the functional programming community: there had come into being
more than a dozen non-strict, purely functional programming languages,
all similar in expressive power and semantic underpinnings.  There
was a strong consensus at this meeting that more widespread use of
this class of functional languages was
being hampered by the lack of a common language.  It was decided
that a committee should be formed to design such a language, providing
faster communication of new ideas, a stable foundation for real
applications development, and a vehicle through which others
would be encouraged to use functional languages.  This
document describes the result of that committee's efforts: a purely
functional programming language called Haskell ,

named after the logician Haskell B. Curry
whose work provides the logical basis for much of ours.<p>
<h2>Goals</h2><p>
The committee's primary goal was to design a language that
satisfied these constraints:
<OL><LI>It should be suitable for teaching, research, and applications,
      including building large systems.
<LI>It should be completely described via the publication of a formal
      syntax and semantics.
<LI>It should be freely available.  Anyone should be permitted to
      implement the language and distribute it to whomever they please.
<LI>It should be based on ideas that enjoy a wide consensus.  
<LI>It should reduce unnecessary diversity in functional 
      programming languages.
</OL><p>
<h2>Haskell  98: language and libraries</h2><p>
The committee intended that Haskell  would serve as a basis for
future research in language design, and hoped that extensions or
variants of the language would appear, incorporating experimental
features.<p>
Haskell  has indeed evolved continuously since its original publication.
By the middle of 1997, there had been four iterations of the language design
(the latest at that point being Haskell  1.4).  At the 1997 Haskell  Workshop 
in Amsterdam, it was decided that a stable variant of Haskell  was needed;
this stable language is the subject of this Report, and is called "Haskell  98".<p>
Haskell  98 was conceived as a relatively minor tidy-up of Haskell  1.4, making
some simplifications, and removing some pitfalls for the unwary. It is intended to
be a "stable" language in sense the <I>implementors are committed to supporting
Haskell  98 exactly as specified, for the foreseeable future</I>.<p>
The original Haskell  Report covered only the language, together with a
standard library called the <tt>Prelude</tt>.  By the time Haskell  98 was
stabilised, it had become clear that many programs need access to a
larger set of library functions (notably concerning input/output and
simple interaction with the operating system).  If these program were
to be portable, a set of libraries would have to be standardised too.
A separate effort was therefore begun by a distinct (but overlapping)
committee to fix the Haskell  98 Libraries.  <p>
The Haskell  98 Language and Library Reports were published in February 1999.<p>
<h2>Revising the Haskell  98 Reports</h2><p>
After a year or two, many typographical errors and infelicities had been
spotted.  I took on the role of gathering and acting on these corrections,
with the following goals:
<UL><LI>Correct typographical errors.
<LI>Clarify obscure passages.
<LI>Resolve ambiguities.
<LI>With reluctance, make small changes to make the overall language more
consistent.
</UL>
This task turned out to be much, much larger than I had anticipated.
As Haskell  becomes more widely used, the Report has been scrutinised by more
and more people, and I have adopted hundreds of (mostly small) changes as 
a result of their feedback.
The original committees ceased to exist when the original Haskell  98 Reports were 
published, so every change was instead proposed to the entire Haskell  mailing list.<p>
This document is the outcome of this process of refinement.
It includes both the Haskell  98 Language Report and the Libraries Report,
and constitutes the official specification of both.
It is <I>not</I> a tutorial on programming in
Haskell  such as the `Gentle Introduction' [<a href="haskell.html#$tutorial">6</a>], and some
familiarity with functional languages is assumed. <p>
The entire text of both Reports is available online (see "Haskell  resources" below).<p>
<h2>Extensions to Haskell  98</h2><p>
Haskell  continues to evolve, going well beyond Haskell  98.  For example, at the
time of writing there are Haskell  implementations that support:
<DL><DT>
Syntactic sugar,
</DT>
 including:
<UL><LI>pattern guards; 
<LI>recursive do-notation;
<LI>lexically scoped type variables;
<LI>meta-programming facilities;
</UL><p>
<DT>
Type system innovations,
</DT>
 including:
<UL><LI>multi-parameter type classes;
<LI>functional dependencies;
<LI>existential types;
<LI>local universal polymorphism and arbitrary rank-types;
</UL><p>
<DT>
Control extensions,
</DT>
 including:
<UL><LI>monadic state;
<LI>exceptions;
<LI>concurrency;
</UL>
</DL><p>
There is more besides.  Haskell  98 does not impede these developments.
Instead, it provides a stable point of reference, so that those who
wish to write text books, or use Haskell  for teaching, can do so in
the knowledge that Haskell  98 will continue to exist.  <a name="sect:resources"></a><p>
<h2>Haskell  Resources</h2>
<p>
The Haskell  web site
<tt><br>

<br>
	http://haskell.org<br>

<br>

</tt>gives access to many useful resources, including:
<UL><LI>Online versions of the language and library definitions, including
a complete list of all the differences between Haskell  98 as published in February 1999
and this revised version. 
<LI>Tutorial material on Haskell .
<LI>Details of the Haskell  mailing list.
<LI>Implementations of Haskell .
<LI>Contributed Haskell  tools and libraries.
<LI>Applications of Haskell .
</UL>
You are welcome to comment on, suggest improvements to, and criticise the language
or its presentation in the report, via the Haskell  mailing list.<p>
<h2>Building the language</h2><p>
Haskell  was created, and continues to be sustained, by an active community of 
researchers and application programmers.  Those who served on the Language and
Library committees, in particular, devoted a huge amount of time and energy to the
language.  Here they are, with their affiliation(s) for the relevant period:<p>

Finally, aside from the important foundational work laid by Church,
Rosser, Curry, and others on the lambda calculus, it is right to
acknowledge the influence of many noteworthy programming languages
developed over the years.  Although it is difficult to pinpoint the
origin of many ideas, the following languages were particularly influential:
Lisp (and its modern-day incarnations Common Lisp and
Scheme); Landin's ISWIM; APL; Backus's FP
[<a href="haskell.html#$back78">1</a>]; ML and Standard ML; Hope and Hope<sup>+</sup>; Clean; Id; Gofer;
Sisal; and Turner's series of languages culminating in 
Miranda (Miranda is a trademark of Research
Software Ltd.). Without these forerunners Haskell  would not have
been possible.<p>
