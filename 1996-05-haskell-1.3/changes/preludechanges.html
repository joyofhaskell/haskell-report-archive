Minor Changes                           </a>
</li></ul>

I have altered the formatting of the Prelude somewhat.  PreludeBuiltin
has been removed since we no longer have interface files and it was
pretty much vacuous.  Also, instance declarations that merely bind
every method onto a primitive have been abbreviated.  Many comments
have been removed - functions like `head' are self-documenting.  I
have also moved comments between the signature and the definition of
an object.  All types now have a data declaration, even when such a
declaration is not syntacticly valid.

<a name="types">
<h4> New Types
</h4>
The following types are now in the Prelude:
<pre>data  Maybe a  =  Nothing | Just a	deriving (Eq, Ord, Read, Show)

data  Either a b  =  Left a | Right b	deriving (Eq, Ord, Read, Show)

data  Void  -- No constructor, not in any classes
</pre>

</a><a name="ord">
<h4> Changes to Ord
</h4>
</a>

In Haskell 1.2, two comparisons are required to do a "three way branch":
<pre>    if x == y then ...
    else if x &lt; y then ...
    else ...
</pre>
Even a standard two way branch can be inefficient - here's the
default definition of "&lt;" in the standard prelude:

<pre>x &lt; y = x &lt;= y &amp;&amp; x /= y
</pre>
Instead of defining a &lt;= operator which returns just two values, it
is almost as easy to define an operator which returns three different
values:
<pre>   case compare x y of
    EQ -&gt; ...
    LT -&gt; ...
    GT -&gt; ...
</pre>
The constructors <tt> EQ </tt>, <tt>LT</tt> ,and <tt>GT</tt> belong to
a new type: <tt>Ordering</tt>.
In addition to this efficiency problem, many uses of <tt>Ord</tt> such as
sorting or operations on ordered binary trees assume total ordering.
The <tt>compare</tt> operation formalizes this concept: it can not
return a value which indicates that its arguments are unordered.
Programmers are free to define a class for partial orderings; here, we
simply state that Ord is reserved for total orderings.
<p>
Changes:
</p><ul>
<li> Add a new type:
<pre>data Ordering = LT | EQ | GT  deriving (Eq,Ord,Ix,Enum,Read, Show)
</pre>
</li><li> Delete comment in definition of class Ord which explains how
to define min and max for both total and partial orders.
</li><li> Change definition of Ord to
<pre>class Eq a =&gt; Ord a where
   compare :: a -&gt; a -&gt; Ordering
   (&lt;), (&lt;=), (&gt;=), (&gt;):: a -&gt; a -&gt; Bool
   max, min	       :: a -&gt; a -&gt; a
   -- circular default definition:
   -- either &lt;= or compare must be explicitly provided
     x &lt; y	  	= compare x y == LT
     x &lt;= y          = compare x y /= GT
     x &gt; y              = compare x y == GT
     x &gt;= y		= compare x y /= LT
     compare x y
       | x == y    = EQ
       | x &lt;= y    = LT
       | otherwise = GT
     max x y = case compare x y of
                LT -&gt; x
                _  -&gt; y
     min x y = case compare x y of
                LT -&gt; y
                _  -&gt; x
</pre>
</li></ul>

<a name="to-from-Enum">
<h4>
Add toEnum and fromEnum to Enum
</h4>
</a>

Haskell 1.2 provides very limited facilities for operating on
enumerations.  The following elementary operations must be implemented
in an obscure and inefficient manner, if at all:
<ul>
<li> Get the next value in enumeration: <tt>(\ x -&gt; head (tail [x..]))</tt>
</li><li> Get the previous value in enumeration: no reasonable way
</li><li> Get the n'th value in enumeration: <tt>[C0..] !! (n - 1)</tt>
     (where <tt>C0</tt> is first in enumeration)
</li><li> Find where a value occurs in an enumeration: <tt>lookup (zip [C0..]
[0..]) x</tt>
</li></ul>
<p>
Changes:
</p><p>
</p><ul>
<li> Add two new methods to Enum:
<pre>   toEnum   :: Int -&gt; a
   fromEnum :: a -&gt; Int
</pre>
Informally, given an enumeration:
<pre> data T = C0 | C1 | ... Cm
</pre>
we have:
<pre> toEnum i | 0 &lt;= i &amp;&amp; i &lt;= m = Ci
          | otherwise           = error "Prelude.toEnum: result out of range"
 fromEnum Ci = i
</pre>
For example, given the datatype:
<pre>
 data Colour = Red | Orange | Yellow | Green | Blue | Indigo | Violet
</pre>
we would have:
<pre> toEnum 0 = Red
 toEnum 1 = Orange
 ...
 toEnum 6 = Violet
 toEnum _ = error "Prelude.toEnum: result out of range"
</pre>
and
<pre> fromEnum Red    = 0
 fromEnum Orange = 1
 ...
 fromEnum Violet = 6
</pre>


</li><li>
Remove ord and chr fromPrelude and replace uses of ord and chr by
fromEnum and toEnum respectively.

</li><li>
Add these definitions to Prelude:
<pre> succ, pred  :: Enum a =&gt; a -&gt; a
 succ = toEnum . (+1) . fromEnum
 pred = toEnum . (+(-1)) . fromEnum
</pre>

</li></ul>
Notes:
<ul>
<li> The types of toEnum and fromEnum could be changed to:
<pre>   toEnum   :: Integer -&gt; a
   fromEnum :: a -&gt; Integer
</pre>

This would allow correct operation across the full range of integers,
floats and doubles - but it's not clear that that is useful or necessary.
The fact that toNum and fromEnum will fail in some instances doesn't
bother us.

</li><li>The instances of <tt>enumFrom[Then][To]</tt> ought to be written
carefully to avoid overflow.  In particular we must avoid either of:
<pre>     [True..] = True : error "succ{Prelude}: result out of range"
     [maxChar..] = maxChar : error "succ{Prelude}: result out of range"
</pre>
This problem is present in Haskell 1.2 for the types Int, Float and
Double where it doesn't seem to be troubling anyone.

</li><li>
This proposal does not affect the cumulative rounding problems found in
float and double.

</li></ul>

<a name="complex">
<h4> Strictness annotations in Ratio and Complex </h4>
</a>

Augustsson's FPCA'94 paper demonstrates very significantly
lower memory requirements when these annotations are added to
<tt>Complex</tt>.  Adding similar annotations to <tt>Ratio</tt>
should have a similar effect.
<p>
Whereas changing the strictness of lists or integers would break
many programs, only the most contrived programs will be affected by
this change.
</p><p>
Changes:
</p><ul>
<li>
Change definitions of Complex and Ratio to (both are now in libraries):
<pre> data (RealFloat a) =&gt; Complex a = !a :+ !a deriving (Eq, Binary, Read, Show)
 data (Integral a)  =&gt; Ratio a   = !a :% !a deriving (Eq, Binary)
</pre>
</li></ul>

<a name="take-drop">
<h4> Using Int in list operations </h4>
</a>

The Haskell 1.2 prelude forces the use of <tt>Integer</tt> rather
than the more efficient <tt>Int</tt> for the very common operations
<tt>take</tt>, <tt>drop</tt>, <tt>!!</tt>, and
<tt>splitAt</tt>.  There are only two circumstances where the
overhead of using <tt>Integer</tt>'s is worthwhile:
<ul>
<li> To pass conformance tests such as:
<pre>   head (take (toInteger maxInt * 2) [1..]) == 1
</pre>
</li><li> When dealing with very large datasets (more than 2^29 elements)
</li></ul>
Users of these very large datasets are probably already using
implementations where maxInt == 2^31-1 or maxInt == 2^63-1
where the problem is less likely to occur.
The old definitions can be placed in a library should problems arise.
<p>
Changes:
</p><ul>
<li>
Change the types of take, drop, !!, and splitAt to:
<pre> take, drop :: Int -&gt; [b] -&gt; [b]
 splitAt :: Int -&gt; [b] -&gt; ([b]. [b])
 !! :: [a] -&gt; Int -&gt; a
</pre>

</li></ul>

<a name="replicate">
<h4>
New functions: replicate, lookup, curry, uncurry.
</h4>
</a>

The following functions are deemed sufficiently useful that they
should be added to the Haskell Prelude.
<p>
Changes:
</p><ul>
<li>
Add replicate and lookup to PreludeList:
<pre>   replicate :: Int -&gt; a -&gt; [a]
   replicate n x = take n . repeat x

   lookup :: Eq a =&gt; a -&gt; [(a,b)] -&gt; Maybe b
   lookup key [] = Nothing
   lookup key ((x,y):xys)
     | key == x  = Just y
     | otherwise = lookup key xys
</pre>

</li><li>
Add curry and uncurry to Prelude:
<pre>  curry :: ((a, b) -&gt; c) -&gt; a -&gt; b -&gt; c
  curry f x y = f (x,y)

  uncurry :: (a -&gt; b -&gt; c) -&gt; (a, b) -&gt; c
  uncurry f p = f (fst p) (snd p)
</pre>
</li></ul>

Notes:
<ul>
<li>
Adding functions in the Prelude rather than a library forces the
automatic import of the name into every Haskell program.
This may break existing code which already uses these names or
 prevent a programmer from using these names for their own
functions.  (This is why we chose the name <tt>replicate</tt> instead
of <tt>copy</tt>.)  It also expands the "vocabulary" of Haskell -
adding an extra name which Haskell programmers can be expected to know.
<p>
In previous discussion, the name <tt>assoc</tt> was preferred to
<tt>lookup</tt> to avoid stealing a useful name from the user.
The library proposal also defines <tt>LibFiniteMap.lookup</tt> and
<tt>LibHashTable.lookup</tt> - we feel that stealing the one name for
three purposes is reasonable.

</p></li><li>
An alternative definition for uncurry is:
<pre>      uncurry f (x, y) = f x y
</pre>
Which is slightly stricter.  Does this matter?

</li></ul>


<a name="diet-haskell">
<h4>
Moving functions to libraries
</h4>
</a>

A large prelude helps the programmer by providing a wide range of
pre-written functions to use and combine.  It also hinders the
programmer by making the language larger to learn, preventing the
programmer from using prelude names for their own purposes and
slowing down compilation.
<p>
It is possible to have our cake and eat it by simply moving rarely
used functions into standard libraries (the language size remains
the same but the "core language" gets smaller).
</p><p>
The following changes are based on counting how many times certain
functions are used in a large body of Haskell programs (i.e. the
Glasgow Haskell repository).
</p><p>
Many functions have been moved: see the new prelude to find out what
remains.

<a name="bounded">
</a></p><h4><a name="bounded">
The Bounded class
</a></h4><a name="bounded">
Add the class
<pre>class Bounded a where
  minBound, maxBound :: a
</pre>
This class provides a convenient name for the minimum and maximum
values in a type.  Instances for <tt>Int</tt> and <tt>Char</tt>
replace <tt>maxInt</tt>, <tt>minInt</tt>, <tt>maxChar</tt>,
<tt>minChar</tt>.  No instance will be defined for floats since it's
not obvious whether to use infinity or the greatest finite value.
Bounded is intended for carrying the range in enumerated classes or
for verifying maps from Integers onto a type.
The bounded
class will be derivable for enumerations and tuples only.  Note these
class methods take no argument: you use
<tt>minBound :: Char</tt> instead of <tt>minBound 'x'</tt>.  This is
inconsistant with the treatment of class-wide parameters (for example,
<tt>floatRadix</tt>) elsewhere but seems to be a cleaner design.

</a><a name="numeric">
<h4> Numeric Issues </h4>
</a>

Haskell 1.2 provides no way to detect IEEE arithmetic values
such as "NaN" or "Infinity".
This seemed reasonable since Haskell 1.2 (and 1.3) doesn't
require IEEE arithmetic.
<p>
Providing everything numerical analysts could ask for requires
a large amount of work, especially since the basic operations do not
fit into the existing numeric classes (Num, Ord, ...).  We are
planning to create a library which will provide strict LIA
conformance.  However, a few simple additions to the numerics will make
it possible to take advantage of some features of IEEE floating point
operations.
</p><p>
Changes:
</p><ul>
<li>
Add methods <tt>isNaN</tt>, <tt>isInfinite</tt>, <tt>isDenormalized</tt>
and <tt>isIEEE</tt> to <tt>RealFloat</tt>:
<pre>  isNaN, isInfinite, isDenormalized, isIEEE, isNegativeZero
        :: RealFloat a =&gt; a -&gt; Bool
</pre>
In non-IEEE implementations, these all return False.
In IEEE implementations, isIEEE returns True and all others
return appropriate responses.

</li><li>
Add line to definition of <tt>showFloat</tt> (this is not explicitly
part of the Prelude but should be supported by implementations):
<pre>  showFloat x =
    if isNaN x then showString "&lt;&lt;NaN&gt;&gt;"
    else if isInfinite x then
       if x &lt; 0 then  showString "&lt;&lt;-Infinity&gt;&gt;"
		else showString "&lt;&lt;Infinity&gt;&gt;"
    else if isNegativeZero x then
             showString ("-0." ++ take (m-2) (repeat '0')
    else if x == 0 then then showString ("0." ++ take (m-1) (repeat '0'))
    else if e &gt;= m-1 || e &lt; 0 then showSci else showFix
    where
    -- remainder of function is unchanged
<li>
It is not necessary for a string that is to be converted to a
floating point number using one of the standard prelude functions
to include a `.' character.  In Haskell 1.2, the expression:
<pre>    read "2" :: Double
</pre>
causes a run-time error; with the new prelude, the result is just
<tt>2.0 :: Double</tt>.

</li></pre>
</li></ul>

Notes:
<ul>
<li>
These changes do not preclude a library for full IEEE  or LIA compatibility.
Such a library is under development.
</li><li>
There is also a need for versions of showFloat which provide
control over the format used and the number of digits displayed
(like the E,F and G format controls in C's printf function).
These will be provided in a library.
</li></ul>

<a name="simplify-lex">
<h4> Simplified Lex </h4>
</a>

The <tt>lex</tt> function is very inefficient and overly complex.
Some of this complexity is necessary to ensure that almost any value that
is printed out using standard Read and Show instances can be read
back in.  (Exceptions: functions and infinite data structures.)
However, <tt>lex</tt> is able to parse several tokens that are never produced
by these Read, Show instances.
<p>
Changes:
</p><ul>
<li>
Remove support in <tt>lex</tt> for:
<ul>
<li> Both forms of comment (change to lex)
</li><li> &lt;- (change to lex)
</li><li> "^&lt;ctrl-char&gt;" tokens (change to lexLitChar)
</li><li> octal tokens          (change to lexLitChar)
</li><li> hex tokens            (change to lexLitChar)
</li><li> ASCII abbreviations for control characters (change to lexLitChar)
</li></ul>

</li><li>
Move <tt>isOctDigit</tt> and <tt>isHexDigit</tt> to the same module
as functions like <tt>isAscii</tt> and <tt>isControl</tt>.
</li></ul>

Notes:

<ul>
<li>
This won't make <tt>lex</tt> or <tt>read</tt> any more efficient.
The problems are:
<ul>
<li> <tt>lex</tt> is built using the same fully backtracking
technology as <tt>read</tt> (it returns a list of alternative parses
instead of a single token) but the resulting flexibility doesn't
seem to be used anywhere.  This imposes a significant overhead with little
reward.
</li><li> <tt>lex</tt> produces strings rather than tokens.  This means
that every token has to be identified twice: once in <tt>lex</tt> where the
input list is split into strings representing tokens and once in
<tt>read</tt> where these strings are matched against required input.
The most effective way of fixing this is to introduce a new datatype
representing each token.
</li><li> Derived instances of <tt>readsPrec</tt> (which is called by
<tt>read</tt>) usually have the following form (see Appendix E):
<pre>   readsPrec d r =
      readCon K1 k1 "K1" r ++
      readCon K2 k2 "K2" r ++
	  ...
      readCon Km km "Km" r
</pre>
In order to successfully parse a string starting with "Km",
readsPrec will call the <tt>lex</tt> function m times.  If
<tt>lex</tt> were separated from <tt>read</tt> by preprocessing the input
 into a token stream, <tt>lex</tt> would only have to be called once.
</li><li>  When parsing a type with infix constructors, the derived
      instance of <tt>readsPrec</tt> may relex and reparse the same
      expression many times.
</li></ul>

</li><li>
Though a good start, this doesn't make <tt>lex</tt> much easier to
understand.  A more effective specification would be a
grammar or regular expression.  This would also simplify the task of
feeding the specification into a Haskell lexer/parser generator or
some similar (more appropriate) implementation technology.

</li><li>
Haskell 1.3 will support hex (and octal) specification of numbers.
It isn't clear whether <tt>lex</tt> should be modified to support this.

</li></ul>

<a name="undefined">
<h4> Undefined </h4>
</a>

Add undefined to the prelude.  Previous proposals used _ or _|_
as the name.
<pre>undefined = error "undefined{Prelude}"
</pre>
It is expected that compilers will recognize this and insert error messages
which are more appropriate to the context in which <tt>undefined</tt>
appears.

<a name="monad-class">
<h4> The Monad class</h4>
</a>

  The Haskell 1.3 IO proposal uses the symbols "&gt;&gt;", "&gt;&gt;=" and
  "return" for the IO monad operations and a separate proposal
  provides syntactic sugar to make monadic code even easier to
  write.  The provision of constructor classes makes it possible
  to define these symbols as methods in a "monad class"
  allowing the symbols and sugar to be used for any monad.
<p>
Changes:

Add these classes to Prelude:
</p><pre>  infixr 1  &gt;&gt;, &gt;&gt;=

  class Functor where
    map :: (a -&gt; b) -&gt; m a -&gt; m b

  class Monad m where
    (&gt;&gt;=) :: m a -&gt; (a -&gt; m b) -&gt; m b
    (&gt;&gt;)  :: m a -&gt; m b -&gt; m b
    return :: a -&gt; m a

  class Monad m =&gt; MonadZero m where
    zero :: m a

  class MonadZero m =&gt; MonadPlus m where
    (++) :: m a -&gt; m a -&gt; m a

</pre>
with Monad instances for <tt>[]</tt>, <tt>Maybe</tt>,
and <tt>IO</tt>; MonadZero and MonadPlus instances for <tt>[]</tt> and
<tt>Maybe</tt>.


<a name="cleanups">
<h4> Minor Changes </h4>
</a>

<ul>
<li>
Improve error messages for maximum and minimum:
<pre>  maximum [] =  error "maximum{PreludeList}: empty list"
  maximum l  =  foldl1 max l
  minimum [] =  error "minimum{PreludeList}: empty list"
  minimum l  =  foldl1 min l
</pre>
The error messages for <tt>head</tt>, <tt>tail</tt>, <tt>init</tt> and
<tt>last</tt> use "[]" in their error messages; these will be changed
to "empty list" for consistency.

</li><li>
Add these equations to end of definitions of take, drop and splitAt.
<pre>  take _ _    = error "take{PreludeList}: negative argument"
  drop _ _    = error "drop{PreludeList}: negative argument"
  splitAt _ _ = error "splitAt{PreludeList}: negative argument"
</pre>

</li><li>
Add backquote to list of symbols in definition of <tt>isSingle</tt>
in definition of <tt>lex</tt>.

</li><li>
Remove <tt>even</tt>/<tt>odd</tt> from <tt>Integral</tt> because
we can't imagine why they're not just normal overloaded functions.

</li><li>
Change error messages to use qualified naming:
<pre>  maximum [] =  error "PreludeList.maximum: empty list"
</pre>
</li><li>
The data type <tt>Assoc</tt> (used in array comprehensions) has been
replaced by tuples.  Occurances of <tt> x := y </tt> must be replaced
by <tt> (x,y) </tt>.
</li><li>
It will be made clear that duplicate indices in array comprehensions
must be detected at runtime by a conforming Haskell implementation.
</li><li> All instances of <tt>index</tt> will generate a nice error
message (mentioning the type involved) when the index is out of range.
</li></ul>
