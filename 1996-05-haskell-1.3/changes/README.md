`from12to13.html` is from
[https://www.haskell.org/definition/from12to13.html].

`preludechanges.html` does not seem to have ever been available on
[https://haskell.org/], but it has been recovered from two other
sources:

* http://www.ki.informatik.uni-frankfurt.de/doc/html/Haskell1.3/preludechanges.html
* https://web.archive.org/web/20050319043520/http://ceng.metu.edu.tr/docs/hugs/preludechanges.htm

For both files, we have fixed and removed hyperlinks so that all of the
links now work.
